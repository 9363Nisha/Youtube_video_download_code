1. Importing Required Libraries:
yt_dlp: A Python library used to download YouTube videos (or videos from other platforms). It is an updated version of youtube-dl.
tkinter: A built-in Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs), used here to open a folder dialog for selecting where to save the downloaded video.
filedialog: A module from tkinter used to create a file/folder selection dialog.
2. download_video Function:
Purpose: This function downloads the YouTube video using yt-dlp.
Parameters:
url: The YouTube URL of the video to be downloaded.
save_path: The folder path where the video should be saved.
Process:
The function sets options for yt-dlp, like specifying the video format (mp4) and the output file name based on the video title.
It then uses yt-dlp.YoutubeDL to download the video from the URL provided.
If successful, it prints "Video downloaded successfully!" If thereâ€™s an error, it prints the error message.
3. open_file_dialog Function:
Purpose: This function opens a folder selection dialog so the user can choose where to save the video.
Process:
It uses filedialog.askdirectory() to prompt the user to select a folder.
If a folder is selected, it returns the folder path. If no folder is selected, it returns None.
4. Main Program (Inside if __name__ == "__main__"):
Purpose: This is the entry point of the program. It starts the program and handles the logic of downloading the video.
Process:
The program hides the main tkinter window (root.withdraw()), as we only need the file dialog.
It then asks the user for a YouTube video URL via input().
Next, it opens the file dialog to let the user select where to save the downloaded video.
If the user selects a folder, the download_video function is called to start downloading the video.
If no folder is selected or an error occurs, appropriate messages are s
